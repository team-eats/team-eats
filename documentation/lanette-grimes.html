            <h3>Why are they here?</h3>
                <p>Lanette loves going out to eat but has a few allergies. She wants to know where she can find a restaurant that she can be sure will have something for her.</p>

                <p>She needs to ebe able to sort through the restaurants around town efficiently without checking every menu.</p>
            <h3>Why us over other options?</h3>
                <p>Our platform allows users and business owners to add food tags, such as "Vegan", "Chinese", "New Mexican", "Gluten Free", to a restaurant's profile which can help discoverability.</p>
            <h3>What frustrates them?</h3>
                <p>Keeping a mental list of places she can eat and regularly checking menus for updates.</p>
                <p>Wanting to try eating somewhere new but having to sort through reviews or manually checking websites for compatible food options.</p>
                <p>A restaurant her friends want to eat at doesn't have a website.</p>
