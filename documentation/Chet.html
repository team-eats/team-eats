<body>
<p>NAME: Jason Bardot </p>
<P>DEVICE: Samsung Galaxy A15 5G A Series 128G Android 14OS with Chrome. HP Pavilion 15.6HD touch screen <br>
    laptop 16GB Ram 1 TB SSD storage, Intel core processor Windows 11OS. Toast POS ELO ESY 10i1B 10" touch screen.</p>

<P>LOVE/HATE: Loves mobility and being able to upload info about his business with ease. Hates being overlooked by <br>
    by possible customers because he does not have enough we exposure.</P>

<p>PROFICIENCY: Pretty good with the web, and able to run his business applications with ease. Able to keep
    up with most social media trends, as well as ordering supplies online.<br></p>

<P>ATTITUDES AND NEEDS: Jason likes to have the feeling of interacting with his customers not only in person <br>
     at his food truck, but online as well. He needs a site that will allow him to relay information <br>
    to the customer such as location changes, menu additions and so on. He wants a site that lets him be seen by the  <br>
    customer. With bigger search sites he feels like it is harder to be seen due to the fact he is just a small local business.</P>

<p>USER STORY: As a weekly user of this site, I would like to be able to update hours and location on the go.</p>
