Capstone idea

Possible features for MVP â€” Business owner

--**HOMEPAGE IDEAS**--

First time a person access team eats site, person is then asked if they are user or business.
// should this be its own page? Or just on the first page?

<!--Coop
when a user opens to the home page they see a list of businesses, they have to navigate to the login/ sign up if they want user functionality. But otherwise can use most **customer** features like normal-->

Say it is a business owner but, one that has an existing account.

//Maybe team eats site prompts for a password?
//Does site require 2step verification system?
<!--coop
probably only business owners need two step-->

--**BUSINESS PROFILE IDEAS**--

Once business owner is allowed on his profile page he can see a display of his menu, his hours/location, where he can create tags, 
and a section where he can create a message with current events or info on the business. The BO can see everything the customer can 
see if a person were to look at a business profile, without any of the access the BO has. This gives BO opportunity to tailor profile page to 
their business.

POSSIBLE FEATURES:
menu display with ability to edit
hours and location display with ability to edit.
section to create tags
current events and special message section with ability to edit.

//Could these be possible features on a Business owners profile page? Could the menu display be something that the BO has control over?
// Could the menu display be something that the BO has control over? Maybe give them the option to update design and content?
//Could we have the same idea for the hours and location?
//Same question for the current events and info box?
//Not too familiar with creating tags??
//A lot of design features maybe more utilized by the food truck BO. I do feel some permanent location BO can make use as well




Say it is a Business Owner that does not have an existing account.

//Is there a way to verify Business licesne that is in scope of our project? Or at least a way to verify 
the person is the owner of the business they are buillding profile for.


Once BO is on future profile page they see they have the ability to create a menu, also create display of hours
location, and a special message/ current events section to display for the customer viewing BO profile. They can even create tags. 
This gives BO opportunity to tailor profile page to their business.

POSSIBLE FEATURES:
menu display with ability to edit
hours and location display with ability to edit.
section to create tags
current events and special message section with ability to edit.


         
huge question of scope that I have are the verification of business owners. One of the Biggest concerns I have
is how to ensure people claiming business are business owner. If there is no way to verify, is there a way to have business profile pages?
<!--COOP
sometimes facebook will require driver's licence as identity verification
there will be less owners than customers, we might want to manually verify at first?
-->

<!--oooh maybe customers can save photos to their profile and have them show up on the listing as well?-->
